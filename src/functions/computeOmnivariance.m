function feature = computeOmnivariance(XYZ,numNeighbours)
% DESCRIPTION
%   For each point in the point cloud, this function derives the
%   omnivariance of the respective local neighborhood.
%
% INPUT VARIABLES
%   XYZ           -   matrix containing the point coordinates [n x 3]
%   numNeighbours -   vector containing the number of neighbors for each
%                     3D point
%
% OUTPUT VARIABLES
%   feature    -   vector containing the values of the selected redefined 
%                  feature
